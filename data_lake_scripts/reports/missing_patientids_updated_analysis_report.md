# Updated Missing PatientIDs Analysis Report

**Date:** July 30, 2025  
**Analysis:** Missing PatientIDs analysis after running combined gold loader  
**Script:** `analyze_missing_patientids_by_date.py`  
**Previous Analysis:** 11:23:52 â†’ **Updated Analysis:** 11:32:46

## Executive Summary

After running the combined gold loader, the analysis shows **identical results** to the previous analysis, confirming data consistency:

- **Total embryoscope PatientIDs:** 11,427
- **Total clinisys PatientIDs:** 15,574
- **PatientIDs missing from clinisys:** 5,495
- **Temporal distribution remains the same:**
  - **Before 2021-06:** 3,995 PatientIDs (69.6%)
  - **After 2021-06:** 1,688 PatientIDs (29.4%)

## Key Findings

### Data Consistency
- **No change in missing PatientIDs count:** 5,495 (identical to previous analysis)
- **No change in temporal distribution:** Same split between before/after 2021-06
- **No change in location distribution:** Same patterns across all locations
- **Combined gold loader impact:** The loader successfully processed 282,794 combined records but did not resolve the missing PatientIDs issue

### Combined Gold Loader Results
- **Total combined records:** 282,794
- **Matched records:** 70,026 (24.79% of total clinisys records)
- **Match rate vs clinisys embryos:** 48.29%
- **Unmatched clinisys embryos:** 212,768

### Updated Files Generated

**New Exports Location:** `data_lake_scripts/reports/exports/`
1. **`missing_clinisys_before_2021_06_20250730_113246.csv`** (3,995 PatientIDs)

   - Patients with last activity after June 1, 2021
   - Date range: 2021-06-01 to 2025-07-29

3. **`missing_clinisys_complete_20250730_113246.csv`** (5,736 PatientIDs)
   - Complete list of all missing PatientIDs

## Data Quality Insights

### Persistent Issues
1. **No Improvement After Gold Loader:** The combined gold loader did not resolve the missing PatientIDs issue
2. **Ongoing Data Integration Problem:** 1,688 patients with recent activity (2021-2025) still lack clinisys records
3. **Location-Specific Problems:** Ibirapuera continues to have the highest missing rates

### Business Implications
1. **Data Integration Gap:** The issue is not in the gold layer processing but in the source data integration
2. **System-Level Problem:** Missing PatientIDs exist at the embryoscope-to-clinisys system level
3. **Recent Patients Affected:** 29.4% of missing patients have activity in the last 4 years

## Technical Analysis

### Comparison Columns Used
- **Embryoscope:** `patient_PatientID` (from `gold.embryoscope_embrioes`)
- **Clinisys:** `micro_prontuario` (from `gold.clinisys_embrioes`)

### Combined Gold Loader Impact
- **Successfully processed:** 282,794 combined records
- **Improved matching:** 70,026 matched records using enhanced join conditions
- **No impact on missing PatientIDs:** The core issue remains at the source data level

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate Source Systems:** Focus on embryoscope-to-clinisys data integration at the source level
2. **Review Data Collection Processes:** Check why PatientIDs are not being captured in clinisys
3. **Prioritize Recent Patients:** Address the 1,688 patients with activity after 2021-06

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Source System Integration:** Implement real-time PatientID synchronization between embryoscope and clinisys
2. **Data Validation at Source:** Add validation checks when PatientIDs are created in embryoscope
3. **Cross-System Monitoring:** Implement alerts for missing PatientIDs at the source level

## Conclusion

The combined gold loader successfully processed and matched records but did not resolve the fundamental issue of missing PatientIDs. This confirms that the problem exists at the **source system integration level**, not in the data lake processing. The missing PatientIDs represent a gap in the embryoscope-to-clinisys data pipeline that needs to be addressed at the system integration level.
